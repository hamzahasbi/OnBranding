This project is powering up my persenal website you can request new features to be added either in backend or frontend.
Feel free to open an issue if you found a bug !


## TODO
Re-implement the API at least using Typescript :
Limitations : 
- Advanced OOP concepts as for inheritance and abstractions!
- Services are a little bit messed up cuz i can't force typed arguments!
- Rules can be controlled much easier if i can force types of each variable!
